We will start with the basic sign up features that django provides by default.

## Registration Form
we have been using the default fields that UserCreationForm provides us. But what if we wanted the email address of the new user which is 
the important part aside from the username and password.For that we can inherit a new form class from UserCreationForm.

Also use the <b> crispy_form bootstrap4 </b> api that helps to manage Django forms. It allows adjusting forms' properties (such as method, send button or CSS classes) on the backend without having to re-write them in the template.

## Login Form
we have been using the default fields that Login View provides us. That authenticate the user with password.

## Employee Info CRUD app
For this we have been using django generic class-based-views.
1. The class <b>EmployeeList</b> takes <b>List View</b> that inherits directly from 1 view and 1 mixin to give this view all the attributes and methods that it has.
2. The class <b>EmployeeDetail</b> takes <b>DetailView</b> inherits directly from 1 view and 1 mixin, that give the detail view of an Employee that it has.
3. The class <b>EmployeeCreate</b> takes <b>CreateView</b> inherits directly from 1 view and 1 mixin, that create/add view of an employee.
4. The class <b>EmployeeUpdate</b> takes <b>UpdateView</b> inherits directly from 1 view and 1 mixin. This view by default follows the same template_naming convention and form principles as the create view and Update the employee infro.
5. The class <b>DeleteView</b> takes <b>DeleteView</b> inherits directly from 1 view and 1 mixin, that delete the view of an employee.

## Create Models in models.py
1. Create <b>Position</b> model, insert title field that store all Employee postions in company. Add this field as a foreign key into <b>Employee</b> table.
2. Create <b>Employee</b> model, insert required Employee Info fields. Add User & Position model keys as forign keys.
